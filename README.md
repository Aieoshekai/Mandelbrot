# Trey's Mandelbrot Visualizer

## Draws the Mandelbrot Set
This fractal browser draws a graphical representation of the mandelbrot number set, and paints the canvas pretty colors depending on pixel distance from the breakout points.

## Drag to Zoom
It allows the user to drag a box anywhere in the image and zoom in to see a deeper view of the fractal.

## Click to Clear/Redraw or Zoom Out One Level
You can click buttons to completely clear and redraw the fractal from the beginning, or to back out to your immediately previous zoom level.
In chrome, it tends to break after you've used it too many times, and you'll need to refresh the page for it to work properly again.
